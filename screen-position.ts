 * When the user clicks on the canvas, we need to know which cell they would have clicked in.
 * This needs to take into account a few things.
 * The map position may have been moved, e.g. scrolling around the map.
 * It also might be that the cell that should be there has its height altered, so visually it now is above or below that position.
