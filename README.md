This is a casual attempt to make an isometric game / game engine.

I'm deliberately trying to discover these things myself. I.e. I want to enjoy making the thing not just try to make it as quickly as possible.

## to run

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- spin up a web server to run `index.html` in the browser. e.g. in vscode you could use the extension `LiveServer`

## tasks

some tasks I could could do...

- make consistent the screen position + where the mouse is
- ~~figure out how to properly calculate the cell the mouse is over~~
- make other canvas objects which sit above/below each other for different renderings, and to be able to make some of them transparent if I feel like it.
- build a little more robust interface to interact with the game thing
- some abstraction for being able to control which images are rendered in cells
- find a way to highlight corners / edges when mouse is over them
- build and animate a vehicle in blender to go into the game
- fix the thing with passing around Grid
