## Things to talk about - some rough notes, to elaborate upon

- I'll try to go through this fairly fast, because there are a few things.
- inspiration (TTD, rollercoaster tycoon, zeus, caesar 3)
- not trying to be "state of the art" with graphics etc -> isometric graphics when growing up
- progressively adding things. Not trying to build everything perfectly from the start.
- I did a maths degree many years ago. I haven't had to use the specific formulas from it for many many years.
- this is not a common "web programming" type of project, but it uses a few technologies from there (and is a project that inspires me)
- canvas
- mapping from a 2d grid to isometric for display
- canvas layers
- click handlers (just "old school" style, because why not)
- ui. First basic html form. Then react
- how to share state from ui to canvas
- redux
